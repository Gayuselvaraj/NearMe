            ​The Dr. M.S. Swaminathan Wetland Eco Park, inaugurated in March 2025, is Chennai's first urban wetland park,
             situated in Porur near Sri Ramachandra University. Spanning 16.63 acres, the park was developed by the Chennai 
             Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) at a cost of ₹15.75 crore. It features a 600-meter wooden boardwalk, 
             pollinator gardens, a basketball court, seating areas, and landscaped channels leading to a six-acre lake, which
              was revived as part of the project . The park is designed to absorb 90% of rainwater, reducing flood risks and 
              replenishing groundwater levels . Named in honor of the late agricultural scientist Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, the 
              park serves as a model for sustainable urban development and aims to raise awareness about wetland ecosystems .​
